## Download

Dowload the ui version of the game from releases and double click the .py file to run the game.

You can also run the game without ui in cli by downloading the non-ui version and running it in cli.

To do this, open a terminal where you have the file and run

```
py RootRace.py
```
## How to play

Simply guess the next digit in the sequence of the square root you are given. 

Gain more points by getting the number with less tries, and by building up first try streaks.
